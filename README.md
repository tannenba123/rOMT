# regularized optimal mass transport (rOMT) applied in Glymphatic-Lymphatic fluid flows 
This project includes code for <br />
(1) rOMT algorithm <br />
(2) Lagrangian representation of Glymphatic Dynamics (GLaD) analysis <br />
(3) Neighborhood-based Cosine Analysis (NCA) <br />
where (1) runs the main rOMT model on the dataset and (2-3) post-processes the results from (1).
