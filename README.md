# regularized optimal mass transport (rOMT) applied in Glymphatic-Lymphatic fluid flows 
This project includes code for <br />
(1) rOMT algorithm <br />
(2) Lagrangian representation of Glymphatic Dynamics (GLaD) analysis <br />
(3) Neighborhood-based Cosine Analysis (NCA) <br />
where (1) runs the main rOMT model on the dataset and (2-3) post-processes the results from (1).

## System Requirements
The code was mainly written and ran in Matlab (R2018a for rOMT algorithm and R2019b for post-processing), with a small section in GLaD analysis ran with Python 3.7.3. 

# Dependencies
(a) NIfTI_analyze https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/8797-tools-for-nifti-and-analyze-image for loading and exporting nifty files <br />
(b) vtkwrite https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/47814-vtkwrite-exports-various-2d-3d-data-to-paraview-in-vtk-file-format for visualization in vtk format <br />

## Demo
The dataset is too large to run on a typical desktop computer, so in this demo we resampled the original data by 0.5.
